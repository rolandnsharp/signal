# Chora Paradigm (Aither ✨)

> *"Space is the receptacle of all becoming."* — Plato's Timaeus

## Coming Soon

The Chora paradigm represents **spatial resonance fields and acoustic space**. Think:
- Reverb (room acoustics, cathedral spaces)
- 3D audio (ambisonics, binaural)
- Field-based synthesis (wavefield, resonance fields)
- Space itself as instrument

### Signature

```javascript
field(state) → [samples]
```

Where:
- `state` = spatial field state (positions, reflections)
- `field` = space transformation (resonance, diffusion)
- Sound exists holistically in space

### Vision

```javascript
Chora.register('cathedral', (state, idx) => {
  return {
    update: (context) => {
      // Model acoustic space
      // Early reflections, late reverberation
      // Spatial resonance modes
      // The room itself sings
    }
  };
});
```

Stay tuned! This paradigm is in development.
