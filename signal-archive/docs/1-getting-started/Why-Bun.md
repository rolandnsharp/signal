# Why Kanon Requires Bun

Kanon commits to Bun as its runtime for technical and philosophical reasons.

## The Technical Reason: Tail Call Optimization

Kanon enables elegant recursive patterns like:

```javascript
'use strict';

const { Y } = require('@rolandnsharp/kanon/src/functional');

// Y-combinator for anonymous recursion
const fibonacci = Y(recurse => (n, a = 0, b = 1) => {
  if (n === 0) return a;
  if (n === 1) return b;
  return recurse(n - 1, b, a + b);
});

// Deep Mandelbrot recursion (200+ iterations)
const mandelbrot = (cx, cy, maxDepth) =>
  Y(recurse => (zx, zy, depth) => {
    if (depth >= maxDepth) return depth;
    const zx2 = zx * zx;
    const zy2 = zy * zy;
    if (zx2 + zy2 > 4) return depth;
    // Tail recursive iteration
    return recurse(zx2 - zy2 + cx, 2 * zx * zy + cy, depth + 1);
  })(0, 0, 0);
```

### The JavaScript TCO Landscape (2026)

**Proper Tail Calls (PTC)** are part of the ES6 specification, but implementation is sparse:

| Runtime | Engine | TCO Support |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Node.js | V8 | ❌ No (removed in 2016) |
| Deno | V8 | ❌ No |
| Bun | JavaScriptCore | ✅ **Yes** (with `'use strict'`) |
| Safari | JavaScriptCore | ✅ Yes |
| Chrome | V8 | ❌ No |
| Firefox | SpiderMonkey | ❌ No |

**Only Bun and Safari** support TCO. V8 removed it because it breaks debuggers and stack traces.

### What This Means

**Without TCO (Node/Deno):**
- Stack overflow at ~10,000 iterations
- Must use trampolining (slow) or iteration (not functional)
- Y-combinator only works for shallow recursion

**With TCO (Bun):**
- ✅ Infinite recursion depth (only limited by maxDepth parameter)
- ✅ Y-combinator works perfectly
- ✅ Deep fractal exploration
- ✅ Pure functional elegance

## The Philosophical Reason: Functional Programming Should Be Free

In languages like Haskell, Scheme, and ML, the Y-combinator is elegant AND fast. Tail recursion is optimized by the compiler, so pure functional code performs as well as imperative loops.

**JavaScript broke this promise.** V8's decision to remove TCO means elegant recursion comes with a performance penalty (or doesn't work at all).

Kanon chooses **not to compromise**. We want:

```javascript
'use strict';

// THIS - elegant, pure, beautiful
const mandelbrot = (cx, cy, maxDepth) =>
  Y(recurse => (zx, zy, depth) => {
    if (depth >= maxDepth) return depth;
    const zx2 = zx * zx, zy2 = zy * zy;
    if (zx2 + zy2 > 4) return depth;
    return recurse(zx2 - zy2 + cx, 2 * zx * zy + cy, depth + 1);
  })(0, 0, 0);
```

**Not this** - pragmatic, but defeats the point:

```javascript
// Not this - iterative workaround
function mandelbrot(cx, cy, maxDepth) {
  let zx = 0, zy = 0;
  for (let depth = 0; depth < maxDepth; depth++) {
    const zx2 = zx * zx, zy2 = zy * zy;
    if (zx2 + zy2 > 4) return depth;
    zx = zx2 - zy2 + cx;
    zy = 2 * zx * zy + cy;
  }
  return maxDepth;
}
```

Bun lets us have our cake and eat it too.

## Performance Benefits

Beyond TCO, Bun offers:

- **11.8x faster** iteration than Node.js (based on our benchmarks)
- **20-40x faster** package installation
- **Instant startup** for TypeScript (no compilation)
- **Integrated tooling** (bundler, test runner, package manager)

For a live coding environment, speed matters. Faster reload = better flow state.

## The Trade-off

**We lose:**
- Node.js compatibility (Kanon won't run on Node/Deno)
- Some npm package compatibility (though most work)

**We gain:**
- Pure functional elegance with Y-combinator
- Infinite fractal depth for generative music
- Better performance across the board
- Modern developer experience

## Is Bun Production-Ready?

**Yes** (as of 2026):
- Version 1.3+ has near-complete Node.js API compatibility
- Used in production by many companies
- Active development and excellent community
- Backed by venture funding (sustainable)

Bun is no longer experimental. It's a legitimate production runtime.

## For Users

If you want to use Kanon:

1. Install Bun: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
2. Install Kanon: `bun install @rolandnsharp/kanon`
3. Run sessions: `bun src/runner.js sessions/your-session.js`

That's it. No complex setup, no compromises.

## For Contributors

All examples and sessions must use `'use strict'` at the top for TCO to work.

Test deep recursion with:
```bash
bun examples/test-mandelbrot-depth.js
```

The philosophy: **Elegance should not require sacrifice.**

**TL;DR**: Bun is the only JavaScript runtime where the Y-combinator and deep recursion just work. For a functional audio synthesis library, that's non-negotiable.
